In this course, you’ll not only master the fundamental skills of OOP but also explore various methodologies to effectively apply these concepts in real-world problem-solving. Gain hands-on experience with practical coding exercises, in-depth theoretical explanations, and industry-focused interview preparation. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)? Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming model that arranges software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. In this approach, an object is defined as a data field with unique attributes (properties) and behavior (methods).\nOOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate, rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach is particularly useful for large, complex programs that require constant updates or maintenance. Areas of application include manufacturing and design programs, as well as mobile applications. For example, OOP can be applied to develop manufacturing system simulation software.\nWhy is Object-Oriented Programming important? Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is important for several reasons:\nReal-world modeling: OOP provides a programming model that reflects how we think about the real world. Objects and classes in OOP can represent real-world entities and concepts naturally, making it easier to understand the code and its relationship to the problem it is solving.\nEncapsulation and information hiding: OOP allows data and functions to be encapsulated within objects, meaning that the internal implementation of an object can be hidden from the outside. This promotes modularity and reduces complexity by providing a clear and consistent interface for interacting with objects.\nFacilitates collaboration: OOP facilitates collaboration among development teams by providing a clear and consistent structure for software design and implementation. Well-defined objects and clear interface contracts allow teams to work independently on different parts of the code.\nFacilitates code maintenance: OOP makes it easier to make changes to the code, as objects and classes are designed to be modular and cohesive. This makes it easier to add new features, fix bugs, and perform updates to existing software.\nScalability: OOP provides a scalable approach to software development, making it easier to manage and extend large and complex projects. It allows for the creation of modular components that can be developed and tested independently.\nOverall, OOP enhances code organization, promotes code reusability, improves code reliability, and simplifies software development. It is widely used in various domains, including software engineering, game development, web development, and more.\nTo truly harness the power of OOP, it’s essential to understand its foundational principles. We invite you to begin your journey by exploring the basic concepts and main principles of OOP:\nBasic Concepts Main Principles "},"title":"Introduction"},"/docs/basic-concepts/":{"data":{"":"","#":" ℹ️ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) relies on fundamental concepts that are essential for building and managing software systems. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is built upon a foundation of core concepts that shape how software is designed, structured, and implemented. These fundamental ideas are essential for creating robust, maintainable, and scalable applications.\nWhen learning OOP, it’s crucial to have a strong understanding of the basic concepts that drive this programming paradigm. These include objects, classes, attributes, methods, and more. Each of these concepts plays a unique role in organizing and managing code effectively.\nTo guide your learning journey, we’ll use a common example: a Bank Account. This example will help illustrate how these basic concepts come together to create a functional and cohesive system.\nReady to learn more? Now that you’ve been introduced to the foundational ideas of OOP, it’s time to dive deeper into each concept. Mastering these basics will set the stage for building powerful applications that follow best practices in software design. Let’s start with a core concept, Classes."},"title":"Basic Concepts"},"/docs/basic-concepts/attributes/":{"data":{"":"","#":" ℹ️ In object-oriented programming (OOP), an attribute (also known as a property or field) is a characteristic or property of an object. It represents the data that an object holds and defines its state. Attributes are defined within a class, and each object created from that class has its own unique values for those attributes. For example, in a BankAccount class, attributes might include the account_number, balance, and account_holder.\nLet’s delve into the concept of attributes considering the BankAccount class. Each bank account object created from this class will have its own set of attributes:\nExample Consider the BankAccount class. Each bank account object created from this class will have its own set of attributes:\nㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤBankAccountㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ account_number: Int balance: Int account_holder: String Suppose we create two BankAccount objects:\nㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤAccount 1ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤAccount 2ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ account_number: 123456 balance: $500 account_holder: John Doe account_number: 789012 balance: $1000 account_holder: Jane Smith In this example, we see that although both Account 1 and Account 2 are instances of the BankAccount class, each object has its own unique attribute values.\nEach object of the BankAccount class shares the same attributes, but the values of these attributes differ from one object to another. This distinction between objects is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, where each object carries its own specific data while sharing the same structure and behavior as defined by the class. Understanding how attributes work helps in managing and manipulating objects effectively within a program."},"title":"Attributes"},"/docs/basic-concepts/class/":{"data":{"":"","#":" ℹ️ A class is a user-defined data type. A class is a blueprint for creating objects that share common properties and behaviors. A class can be thought of as a blueprint that defines the structure of objects in a program. It’s like a mold from which individual objects are created, each with its own attributes and behaviors.\nLet’s consider the concept of a class using the example of a BankAccount.\nA class is like a blueprint or template for creating objects. In our example, the BankAccount class represents the blueprint for creating individual bank account objects.\nㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤBankAccountㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ account_number : Int balance : Int account_holder : String +deposit (amount) +withdraw (amount) Attributes: Attributes are characteristics or properties that describe the objects created from the class. For instance, in the case of a BankAccount, attributes could include account_number, balance, and account_holder. Methods: Methods are functions that define the behavior of the objects created from the class. In the context of a BankAccount, methods could include operations like deposit and withdraw, which specify how money can be added to or withdrawn from an account. This class blueprint defines the structure for creating BankAccount objects. Each object instantiated from this class inherits attributes such as account number, balance and account holder. Additionally, the methods such as deposit() and withdraw(), enable the objects to perform operations like adding or withdrawing money."},"title":"Classes"},"/docs/basic-concepts/methods/":{"data":{"":"","#":" ℹ️ In object-oriented programming, methods define the actions that an object can perform. They are functions within a class that describe the behaviors or operations of the objects created from the class. Methods are integral to how objects interact with each other and perform tasks. Let’s explore this concept using the BankAccount class example:\nㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤBankAccountㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ +deposit (amount) +withdraw (amount) Methods in Action: For instance, let’s use the BankAccount class to create two bank account objects:\nㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤAccount 1ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤAccount 2ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ account_number: 123456 balance: $500 account_holder: John Doe account_number: 789012 balance: $1000 account_holder: Jane Smith +deposit (amount) +withdraw (amount) +deposit (amount) +withdraw (amount) Example of Method Usage: Account 1 can use the deposit method to add funds and the withdraw method to withdraw funds. Account 2 has the same methods but can perform deposit and withdraw operations based on its own balance and account details. Each object has access to the same methods defined in the class, which enables them to perform similar actions, but the outcomes of these methods depend on the object’s specific attributes and current state.\nExplore the Main Principles chapter to learn more about how methods integrate with the core principles of OOP, including inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.

Por ejemplo, para generar una lista con los elementos elemento1, elemento2 y elemento3 se utiliza:\n- elemento1 - elemento2 - elemento3 Si se quiere hacer una lista ordenada secuencialmente, se utiliza el símbolo 1. seguido del elemento de la lista. Por ejemplo, para generar una lista con los elementos elemento1, elemento2 y elemento3 se utiliza:\n1. elemento1 2. elemento2 3. elemento3 Si se quiere hacer una lista anidada, se utiliza el símbolo - seguido del elemento de la lista. Por ejemplo, para generar una lista con los elementos elemento1, elemento2 y elemento3 se utiliza:\n- elemento1 - elemento2 - elemento3 Imagenes Para insertar una imagen se utiliza el siguiente código:\n![Texto alternativo](/ruta/a/la/imagen) por ejemplo, si queremos poner la imagen de este link https://source.unsplash.com/featured/800x600?landscape, se utiliza:\n![Texto alternativo](https://source.unsplash.com/featured/800x600?landscape) y el resultado será así Videos Para insertar un video se utiliza el siguiente código:\n{{\u003c youtube id_del_video \u003e}} por ejemplo, si queremos poner el video de este link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da-2h2B4faU, se utiliza:\n{{\u003c youtube Da-2h2B4faU \u003e}} y el resultado será así Bloques de código Para insertar un bloque de código se utiliza la siguiente sintaxis usando backticks (`):\n```el lenguaje en el que queremos poner el código el código que queremos poner ``` por ejemplo, si queremos poner un bloque de código en Python, se utiliza:\n```python def say_hello(): print(\"Hello!\") ``` y el resultado será así\ndef say_hello(): print(\"Hello!\") Bloques de código con números de linea Para insertar un bloque de código con números de linea se utiliza linenos=table y opcionalmente se pone linenostart=(número de línea) para definir en qué número de línea empieza el código. Todo esto usando la siguiente sintaxis y usando backticks (`):\n```el lenguaje que queremos poner{linenos=table, linenostart=(número de línea)} el código que queremos poner ``` por ejemplo, si queremos poner un bloque de código en Python, se utiliza:\n```python{linenos=table, linenostart=18} def say_hello(): print(\"Hello!\") ``` y el resultado será así\n18 19 def say_hello(): print(\"Hello!\") Copiar código El botón de copiado está activado por default para cada bloque de código.\nEnlaces Para insertar un enlace se utiliza la siguiente sintaxis:\n[Texto del enlace](/ruta/al/enlace) por ejemplo, si queremos poner un enlace a la página principal de la asignatura, se utiliza:\n[Enlace a la página principal](https://arojaspe.github.io/Hugo-POO-UN/) y el resultado será así\nEnlace a la página principal\nTablas Para insertar una tabla se utiliza la siguiente sintaxis:\n| Columna 1 | Columna 2 | Columna 3 | |-----------|-----------|-----------| | Elemento 1 | Elemento 2 | Elemento 3 | |------------|------------|------------| | Elemento 4 | Elemento 5 | Elemento 6 | y el resultado será así\nColumna 1 Columna 2 Columna 3 Elemento 1 Elemento 2 Elemento 3 Diagramas Para insertar un diagrama se utiliza Mermaid. Mermaid es una herramienta basada en Javascript que permite generar diagramas y diagramas de flujo a partir de texto. Para más información sobre Mermaid, se puede consultar la documentación oficial. Se pueden generar todo tipo de diagramas, como diagramas de flujo, diagramas de secuencia, diagramas de clases, diagramas de Gantt, etc. Para insertar un diagrama se utiliza la siguiente sintaxis:\n```mermaid graph TD; A--\u003eB; A--\u003eC; B--\u003eD; C--\u003eD; ``` y el resultado será así\ngraph TD;\rA--\u003eB;\rA--\u003eC;\rB--\u003eD;\rC--\u003eD;Se recomienda el uso de un editor de Mermaid para facilitar la construcción del diagrama como Mermaid.live\nElementos adicionales Callouts Un callout es un elemento que permite resaltar un texto. Para insertar un callout se utiliza la siguiente sintaxis:\nCallout default {{\u003c callout \u003e}} En esta página se encuentra el tutorial para construir el sitio web de la asignatura de POO. {{\u003c /callout \u003e}} y el resultado será así\nEn esta página se encuentra el tutorial para construir el sitio web de la asignatura de POO. Callout de información {{\u003c callout type=\"info\" \u003e}} En este callout se encuentra información importante. {{\u003c /callout \u003e}} y el resultado será así\nℹ️ En este callout se encuentra información importante. Callout de advertencia {{\u003c callout type=\"warning\" \u003e}} Este callout está pensado para atraer la atención de quien lo lee. {{\u003c /callout \u003e}} y el resultado será así\n⚠️ Este callout está pensado para atraer la atención de quien lo lee. Callout de error {{\u003c callout type=\"error\" \u003e}} Este callout está pensado para indicar que algo ha salido mal. {{\u003c /callout \u003e}} y el resultado será así\n🚫 Este callout está pensado para indicar que algo ha salido mal. Botones (cards) Un botón es un elemento que permite resaltar un enlace. Para insertar un botón se utiliza la siguiente sintaxis:\n{{\u003c cards \u003e}} {{\u003c card link=\"la ruta del archivo al que se quiere dirigir\" title=\"Nombre botón\" icon=\"ícono\" \u003e}} {{\u003c card link=\"/ruta\" title=\"Siguiente botón\" \u003e}} {{\u003c /cards \u003e}} Botón de ejemplo Botón secundario Los nombres de los íconos pueden ser reemplazados por los disponibles en Heroicons\nTutoriales adicionales Markdown Guide Markdown Cheatsheet Markdown Tutorial Markdown Reference Hextra guide ","títulos-y-textos#Títulos y textos":"","videos#Videos":""},"title":"Tutorial"}}
